		<h1> Virgo (8.23 ~ 9.22) </h1>
			
			<h3>Background</h3>
			
				<p>In Greek mythology, Virgo is the incarnation of the goddess of the earth, Demeter, and in some cases, the incarnation of her daughter Persephone. The evil god Astaroth, who is in charge of production, may refer to her as recorded in the Bible.</p>
			
				<p>The god of agriculture, the god of agriculture, and the mother of the earth in Greece, Dimit, is the sister of Zeus. There is a beautiful only child, Persephone. She is the splendid goddess of spring. She will open wherever she lightly steps. Full of delicate flowers. One day she and her companions were picking flowers on a meadow in the valley. Suddenly, she saw a silver daffodil with a sweet taste floating in the air. Persephone thought: "It is better than any of my flowers. Beautiful!” She was so beautiful, so she sneaked closer away from her companion, reaching out her hand about to touch the flower. Suddenly, a hole broke in the ground, and a carriage, driven by two black horses, rushed out of the ground. It turned out to be Pluto. Hades (Hades), because of his admiration for "the most beautiful spring god" Persephone, he set up a trick to take her away.</p>
				
				<p>Persephone’s cry for help echoed between the valley and the ocean. Of course, it also reached the ears of her mother Demit. Demit was very sad. She left the harvested grains and flew over thousands of rivers. Looking for daughter.</p>
			
				<p>There is no Mother Earth in the world, seeds no longer germinate, and fertile soil cannot produce clusters of wheat ears. Humans are going to starve to death. Seeing this, Zeus ordered Hades to release Persephone, Hades. Had to obey Zeus, but he had a trick in the dark. Before leaving, he gave Persephone a fruit-hell pomegranate. Persephone had to return to the dark and smelly hell after eating this fruit.</p>
			
				<p>Zeus had no choice but to say to Hades: "In a year, you will only be with Persephone for a quarter of the time." From then on, as long as the earth is full of frost and no grass grows, people will know that it is because Persephone has gone to the underworld again. Virgo symbolizes the beauty and purity of Persephone, the goddess of spring, and the wheat ears raised by her mother have also become what she holds.</p>
			
				<p>Another thing is that Virgo represents the goddess of justice Astoria, who returned to the sky after being disappointed with humans and became Virgo, and the Libra used to judge the good and evil of human beings became Libra.</p>
