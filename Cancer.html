			<h1> Cancer (6.22 ~ 7.22) </h1>
			
			<h3>Background</h3>
			
				<p>Legend has it that a long time ago, when He Wuli fought against the snake monster Hydra, a Cancer raised out of the sea to help the snake monster bit He Wuli’s ankle. Later, the cancer was killed by He Wuli and fell on On a small island in the Aegean Sea. The Cancer did not complete the task of the goddess Hera, and was cursed. The curse spread to the Queen of Athens. When Princess Melo of Athens was born, a prophet predicted that when the princess got married, it was when the queen died. For this prophecy, the queen never asked the princess to marry. Until Melo was twenty years old, a prince called Suosa came to Athens.</p>
			
				<p>Suo Sa came here admiringly, he wanted to marry Melo as his wife, and Mei Luo fell in love with him when he first saw Suo Sa. However, the curse is terrible, and the princess does not want to sacrifice her mother's life just for her own happiness. So she tried her best to stop her and her desire. He set nine levels, just like nine impossible tasks, unless he did everything one by one, he could marry Melo. However, all the heroes did it one by one! The princess was caught in a dilemma. For the sake of her daughter's happiness, the great mother resolutely decided to marry Melo to Susa. On the day when Melo and Sosa were married, the queen was not there. She didn't want any accidents at the banquet to spoil the atmosphere. The queen quietly walked to the beach alone, greeted the waves of the Aegean Sea, and committed suicide. When people couldn’t find the queen, they found a huge crab on the sea. Its arms were wrapped around its chest. Hera felt insecure. Hera regretted it a little bit after learning about it, so she let the crab in the sky. Become a constellation, its image is like a Cancer.</p>
			
				<p>A story in Greek mythology emphasizes the unique aggressiveness of Cancer: Hewuli is the son of Zeus and Fan, and the queen Sheila will put him to death twice: he is also the greatest hero in Greece and the strongest man in the world. . There is nothing in the world that he couldn't do. Even the gods conquered the giants with his assistance. Of course, Hewuli also made a lot of contributions to the gods. One day he came to the kingdom of Messini and was preparing to receive a heroic welcome. However, the king was instructed by Sheila to present him with a problem-killing the Hydra living in the swamp area. This is very difficult to do. , Because every time a head is cut off, countless heads are born immediately.</p>
			
				<p>He Wuli thought of a way-to scorch the snake heads with fire, so that eight snake heads were easily solved. Seeing that there is only the last one left, Sheila is furious with anger in the sky. Could it be that she has failed again this time? She is not reconciled! So a huge crab was called from the sea to hinder Hewuli. The Cancer stretched out powerful crabs to clamp Hewuli's feet, but everyone knows that Hewuli is the strongest person in the world! The Cancer finally died under his brute force.</p>
			
				<p>Sheila failed again, but she felt afflicted by Cancer's desperate sacrifice. In order to appreciate Cancer's loyalty to her mission, Sheila still placed it in the sky and became Cancer.</p>
