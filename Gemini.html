			<h1> Gemini (5.21 ~ 6.20) </h1>
			
			<h3>Background</h3>
			
				<p>Borax, the son of god and Castor, the son of man, are both brave and adventurous warriors, and they often join hands to make feats. They also have twin cousins-Idas and Links. One day the four of them were going to catch the cows. When they caught a lot of cows and were about to split, the greedy Idas and Links took advantage of Pollax and the Castor brothers to take all the cows back when they were unprepared. The enraged two twins quarreled, and Idas stabbed Castor to death with an arrow. Pollax was so sad that he wanted to go to heaven with Castor, but he couldn't do so because of his eternal life. His grief moved Zeus, and he set up a constellation for the two of them to live in the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of death.</p>
			
			<h3>Character</h3>
			
				<p>The biggest characteristic of Geminis in terms of personality is their extremely keen observation ability. Geminis are very skillful and can show their talents in all aspects.

This dual character will make Gemini people have contradictions in life, like fantasy, and are easily satisfied with contemplation and daydreaming. But it is full of inspiration and imagination. That's why people in this constellation have many writers, founders of new art, inventors, composers, and so on. The advantage is the potential artistic talent, the disadvantage is the tendency to procrastinate, selfish, not caring about other people's feelings and thoughts, nervousness, and not getting along well.</p>

				<p>Geminis have many talents, they move fast and powerful, intuitive and enterprising, free of worries, happy and lively, smart and fickle. Good speech, unique thinking, strong imagination, sense of humor, good observation and comprehension, and witty. The appearance is very enthusiastic, but the heart is very cold.</p>
			
				<p>I like to have two occupations, two romances, a life full of changes, and frequent travel. Has great adaptability to different environments and is good at adapting to changes. People with this constellation are more controlled by reason, are not easily emotional, and rarely experience deep love.</p>
			
			<h3>Advantages</h3>

			<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
			
				<p>Gemini often has only three minutes of heat, fickleness, lack of principles in life, inferiority, too neurotic, not deep in doing things, too sleek, easy to be nervous, unsteady, unreliable, inattentive, skeptical, Fickle, dual personality, lack of patience, cunning, restless, and violent and chattering when the extraordinary energy fails to vent. Unsteady. Do things halfway through.</p>

				<p>Because Geminis are very talkative, they often feel frivolous and insecure. Their personality changes, making them unpredictable and annoying. Because of their curiosity, they always like to try in many ways, but they can’t follow through to the end. In life or emotions, I like to change, and my transformation is a playful type.</p>
