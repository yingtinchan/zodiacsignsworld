			<h1> Sagittarius <br> (11.22 ~ 12.21) </h1>
		
			<h3>Background</h3>
			
				<p>Hercules, the great hero in ancient Greek mythology, accidentally injured his teacher Chiron in a process of hunting down the centaur robber, using the indestructible arrow given by the teacher. The arrow passed through the body of a centaur robber and hit Chiron's throat behind. Chiron was originally immortal, but Hercules' arrows were soaked in the blood of Hydra (also translated as Hydra), and Chiron felt more pain than death. At that time, Prometheus was tied to the Caucasus Mountains and tortured by Zeus because he had stolen the sky fire for human use. One day, Hercules came here in search of Hesperides. He saw the evil eagle pecking at Prometheus' liver. At this moment, he took out the bow and arrow and shot the evil eagle from the side of Prometheus' liver. Then he loosened the chains, freed Prometheus, and took him off the cliff. But in order to meet the conditions of Zeus, Hercules left Chiron on the cliff as a stand-in. Although Chiron could ask for eternal life, he was willing to give his life because he suffered from the venom of Hydra in order to save Prometheus. Chiron decided to exchange himself with Prometheus, freeing Prometheus from suffering and giving up eternal life, so that both parties could be free. Zeus ascended to the sky and became a Sagittarius holding a bow and arrow.</p>
