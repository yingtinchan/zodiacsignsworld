		<h1> Scorpio (10.23 ~ 11.21) </h1>
			
			<h3>Background</h3>
			
				<p>Faeuton, the son of the sun god Apollo, is naturally beautiful and sexy, and he himself feels arrogant because of this. His attitude is always arrogant and rude. His too strong personality often makes him unwittingly offend many people. One day, someone told Phaeton and said, "You are not the son of the sun god!" After speaking, he laughed and left. How could the strong Phaeton swallow this breath, so he asked his mother: " Am I the son of Apollo?” But no matter how his mother assured him that he was indeed born of Apollo, Pharton still didn’t believe his mother, so he said, “The one who made fun of you is the son of Zeus, and his status is very high. Gao, if you still don’t believe it, then ask the sun god Apollo himself!” Apollo listened to his son’s question and smiled and said, “Don’t listen to their nonsense, of course you are my son!” Phaeton still insisted. Believe it or not, of course he knew that the sun god never lied, but he had another purpose-to drive his father's sun cart to prove that he was the son of Apollo. "How can this be done?" Apollo was shocked. The sun is the ruler of all living things. If you are not careful, it will cause a huge disaster. Haughty and arrogant, he jumped into the car without listening, and galloped away. The result was of course very miserable. People, animals, and plants on the ground either died from heat or freeze to death. They also messed up the time and made the world go dark and complained. In order to stop Faethon, the gods released a poisonous scorpion from Queen Hera. The poisonous scorpion attacked Faethon. Faethon had no time to react. The poisonous scorpion bit Faethon’s ankle, and Zeus used it. The terrible thunderbolt struck Faethon, and saw Faethton screamed and fell to the ground. Faethton finally died, and peace was restored to the world, in memory of the poisonous scorpion that was also killed by lightning, this constellation. It was named "Scorpio".</p>
